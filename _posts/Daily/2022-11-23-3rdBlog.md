Some business idea sounds wonderful and at a glance, it seems so promising and fun. However, it can be totally different story when you analyse its earning models and effects, feasibilities, and especially the logics behind it. Yes, while I studied and experienced several business models, I realised the logic (why this business is needed and how it should be structured within that reasons, and what it will bring as a result) is the most important part for planning business. Gamification of Education is not a new concepts at all and many times it failed. I am not against the gamification. However, I want to point out certain conditions would be required to make a successful, sustainable gamified education business.
