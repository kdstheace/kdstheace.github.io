Some business idea sounds wonderful and at a glance, it seems so promising and fun. However, it can be totally different story when you analyse its earning models and effects, feasibilities, and especially the logics behind it. Yes, while I studied and experienced several business models, I realised the logic "Why-Model-Result"(why this business is needed and how it should be structured within that reasons, and what it will bring as a result) is the most important part for planning business. Gamification of Education is not a new concepts at all and many times it failed. I am not against the gamification. However, I want to point out certain conditions would be required to make a successful, sustainable gamified education business.

## Why: Gamification?

Obviously, the reason for gamification is to arouse students' interest in study. However, it would be difficult to beat the other game solely focus on fun, especially when the edu-game requires something to memorize or its contents dig deep of certain field. Even though there are well-made edu-games around the world, however, students play the game more violent and provocative instead of edu-game, because now matter how fun the edu-game is, it needs the process of constant learnings which can exhaust players. Of course, you can say the education cannot always be memorizing knowledge and understanding deeply. I do agree with it, there must be certain way to be fun, but it is not about whether gamification or not. It is more about educational skills and models.

## Model: Unflexible

Gamification can make education less flexible. Contrary to the conventional way of lecture, today's education trend is not unilateral. People gather togeter, raise the topic by themselves and teach what they learned to each other. That is because of fast-changing information and those information can be easily obtained throughout the network. You might think of metaverse or similar platform, and I highly agree that metaverse will change the paradigm of people's interaction and education methods. However, gamification here is not about just making platform that people can meet each other. The gamification is, programifying the education, which needs more time to create, update the contents compared to verbal lecture and text. There are so many hurdles to get through to make and update the one Software. You might already experience silly edu-game when you were young, which was so easy sometimes but keep showing those easy contents that makes you feel bored. However, in the lecture, the lecturer can switch their contents to meet students' level and deal with certain students who excel the others. In this sense, gamification can make education more monolithic.

## Result: Side effects

- 만약 이유도 완벽했고, 모델도 완벽했다고 해보자. 정말 교육을 게임으로 했더니 아이들은 재미있는 대상이라고 생각했고, 게임또한 교육자에 필요에 따라서 마음대로 바꿀 수 있게 되었다. 하지만, 그 영향은 좋기만 할까?
  모든 교육영역이 게임이 되지 않는 이상 학생들은 학습자체에 대한 의욕을 잃을 우려가 있다. 우리가 학습을 하는 것은 배움의 목적 외에도 텍스트나 강의에 대해 인내하며 지식을 얻는 능력을 배운다. Easy come, Easy go라는 말이 있듯이 때로 어떤 지식은 어렵게 학습되거나, 몇년에 걸친 연구로 얻게 된다. 게임에 익숙해진다면 이런 훈련 기회를 잃어버리는 것이다. 아직 발견되지 못한 지식, extra research and study가 필요한 지식들까지 게임이 될수는 없기 때문이다.
