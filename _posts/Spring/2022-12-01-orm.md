-will be updated as my study goes by-
I've been using Spring Data with JPA throughout the projects and I thought it would be great if I write the overal concepts and features of Spring Data.

## **1. Object-Relational Mapping(ORM)**

#### Before ORM

For mapping the physical model(relational DB) to the logical model(Java Domain Objects), developers should open a transaction, make a SQL query which returns the records.
For each record, system should iterates through each field in a record, extracts field, converts to proper data type, and map to the java object/attributes.
And then close the transaction.

#### With ORM

By declaring metadata(XML/annotations) to map Java classes and attributes to DB tables and columns, Framework then handle actual DB interactions. Code becomes clean and a lot easier to maintain.<br>

#### What is JPA

JAP is not a framework, it is specification. Framework in this case can be Hibernate, TopLink, Java EE application servers.

Java entities = table<br>
Java attributes = Column//fileds<br>
Entity Manager = CRUD entities

Example of logical and physcial data structure

#### JPQL(Java Persistence Query Language)

JPQL is the language which interacts with entities and their persistent state. It is portable to any DBMS.
